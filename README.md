# About Pepper the Pepbot 
Pepper the Pepbot is a slack bot that allows teammates to send positive feedback anonymously to their coworkers. 

[Research shows] [3] positive feedback creates more effective teams, with high performing teams sharing *six times* more positive feedback than average ones. We think that a little extra encouragement and appreciation can go a long way in creating a more productive workplace. Pepper is that little nudge each week to say something nice!

# Getting Started

The Pepper team is currently working on getting Pepper deployed- updates soon!

Eventually, you'll be able to go to our landing page [here][2] and click the 'Add to Slack Button' - it's that easy!

# Awards and Press
Pepper the Pepbot was the winning application of Vancouver's [AngelHack][1] #LadyProblems Hackathon in November 2016.
